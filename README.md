# sentiment_analysis_yandex

## Description

A customer came to your company and needs a solution of the problem of analyzing the sentiment of smartphone reviews. The customer wants you to evaluate the possible performance of such an algorithm on a small test sample (only 100 reviews, without labels). No more data is provided to you.

You have to look at the reviews provided by the customer, collect similar reviews as a training sample, and experiment with setting the problem (label positive and negative examples) so that the result on the customer's reviews is as good as possible (strictly more than 85%).

This project was implemented as part of the 6th online course ["Data analysis project"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-project) of the specialization ["Machine learning and data analysis"](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-data-analysis).

The quality assessment of the trained algorithm is checked using an automatic system in the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/morecomplicatedsentiment).

Over 23000 reviews and their scores were collected from the Yandex market to train the model. After data cleaning and preparation part the algorithm was trained on more than 6000 reviews. The quality of the model on customer's data is 95.5%. 


For demonstrating the work of the model the demo-site on Flask was created.
